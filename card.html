			<p>Dolphins often display a playful attitude which makes them popular in human culture. They can be seen jumping out of the water, riding waves, play fighting and occasionally interacting with humans swimming in the water.
				 Dolphins are part of the family of toothed whales that includes orcas and pilot whales. Killer whales are actually dolphins. They are found mostly in shallow seas of the continental shelves, and are carnivores, mostly eating fish and squid.
				<p>Female dolphins are called cows, males are called bulls and young dolphins are called calves. Dolphins are very social, living in groups that hunt and even play together. Large pods of dolphins can have 1,000 members or more.
					 Dolphins communicate with each other by clicking, whistling and other sounds.
